# Restaurant Data Analysis Project - Level 2

## Overview

In this second phase of the project, we delve into a more detailed analysis of restaurant data. The focus is on understanding table booking and online delivery features, analyzing price ranges, and engineering new features from existing data. This phase aims to enrich the dataset and uncover deeper insights into restaurant ratings and customer preferences.

## Level 2: Detailed Analysis and Feature Engineering

### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery

- **Table Booking Analysis**
  - Calculated the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking.
  - Compared the average ratings of restaurants with table booking versus those without.
  - Analyzed the availability of online delivery across different price ranges.

### Task 2: Price Range Analysis

- **Price Range Exploration**
  - Determined the most common price ranges among restaurants.
  - Calculated the average rating for each price range.
  - Identified the color associated with the highest average rating among different price ranges, providing a unique visual twist to the analysis.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering

- **Feature Extraction**
  - Extracted additional features from existing data, such as the length of restaurant names or addresses.
  - Created new features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables, adding new dimensions to the dataset.

## Files

- `tablebook.py` – Contains code for analyzing table booking and online delivery.
- `price.py` – Includes code for exploring price ranges and their impact on ratings.
- `feature.py` – Contains code for feature extraction and encoding.
